What happens when you type google.com and hit enter?

Ever pondered the intricate processes that power the seemingly effortless act of accessing websites? This post takes you on a journey through the complex layers of the internet, revealing the behind-the-scenes magic that occurs when you type “google.com” and press Enter. From the fascinating world of DNS requests and load balancing to the critical roles played by SSL encryption, firewalls, and servers. Join me as I attempt to demystify the enchanting workings of the digital realm, providing insights into the seamless orchestration of technologies that shape your online experience.

DNS request: When you enter “https://www.google.com" into your browser and hit Enter, your computer starts a DNS (Domain Name System) query to translate the user-friendly domain name “www.google.com" into an IP address. This translation is necessary because computers communicate with each other using IP addresses. Before initiating a DNS query, the browser first checks its local cache to see if it already has the IP address for the domain name “www.google.com" stored. If there is no cached entry, the browser proceeds to send a DNS query to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to check if they have the IP address in their local cache. If the ISP does not have the required information, the browser’s request is directed to DNS servers located on the internet. These servers work together in a collaborative manner to resolve the domain name into its corresponding IP address.

Consider that you looking to dine in a particular restaurant that you overheard in a conversation. The first thing you do is check your address book if you have the address of that restaurant. Seeing that this is a restaurant you haven’t visited before, you wouldn’t have the address so perhaps you go to a friend or a local guide to help you locate it. If whoever you go to meet has said address, that simplifies things. However, if not you have to broaden your search and perhaps you decide to consult a citywide directory or an online map to expand your search for the restaurant’s location. In the digital world, the equivalent of your address book is the browser’s local cache, storing familiar addresses for quicker access. The friend or local guide represents the Internet Service Provider (ISP), a closer resource that might have the required information in its cache.

Now, imagine the restaurant you are searching for is not just in your city but part of a vast network spread across different locations. In this scenario, the DNS servers on the internet act as a comprehensive directory, much like an extensive city guide or a global mapping system. They collaborate to pinpoint the exact address (IP address) of the restaurant (website server) you’re looking for, ensuring that your journey to establish a connection with the server hosting the desired website is successful. Just as in the real world, this multi-tiered process ensures efficiency in navigating the expansive landscape of the internet, guiding you seamlessly to your digital destination.

TCP/IP: Once the DNS resolution process is successfully completed, your browser proceeds to establish a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server. TCP plays a vital role in ensuring the reliable and ordered delivery of data between your computer and the server. This is achieved through a series of handshakes, where both ends of the connection agree on various parameters and establish a secure channel for data transmission.

With the TCP connection established, the next step is for the data packets to be routed across the network to reach the intended destination. This is where the Internet Protocol (IP) comes into play. IP handles the task of addressing and routing the data packets, ensuring they are correctly directed to the intended server. Each packet is assigned an IP address that identifies its source and destination, allowing routers and other network devices to accurately route the packets through the network.

Continuing with our metaphor, having successfully acquired the restaurant’s address, you arrive at the location, eager to experience what it has to offer. Upon entering, you greet the receptionist, initiating a courteous interaction much like the handshakes in the digital world. These handshakes, equivalent to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection, establish a secure and reliable channel for communication, ensuring a smooth exchange of information between your browser (you) and the server (restaurant staff).

Just as the receptionist acknowledges your presence, data packets in the digital realm are acknowledged as they traverse the network. Now, it’s time to proceed to your table, much like the routing of data packets across the network. This is where the Internet Protocol (IP) comes into play, addressing and directing the packets to their intended destination, just as the restaurant staff guides you to Table 5.

As you settle at your designated table, perhaps placing an order to savor the restaurant’s offerings, each step in this metaphor mirrors the precision and order established by TCP and IP in the digital interaction. The orchestrated dance between protocols ensures that your data, like your dining experience, is reliably delivered to its intended destination, enhancing the overall efficiency and satisfaction of your online journey.

Firewall: Before the data packets can reach the desired server, they may encounter a firewall. Firewalls act as a protective barrier between your computer and the internet, monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic. Their primary purpose is to enforce security measures by inspecting the data packets and applying predefined rules and policies.

Passing through the firewall, the data packets undergo a thorough inspection. The firewall checks if the packets meet the security criteria defined by the network administrator or the firewall’s configuration. This inspection ensures that potentially harmful or unauthorized traffic is blocked, safeguarding your computer and the network from potential threats.

If the data packets meet the security criteria, they are allowed to pass through the firewall and continue their journey to the intended server. On the other hand, if the packets are flagged as suspicious or in violation of the security policies, the firewall blocks them, preventing any unauthorized access or potential security breaches.

HTTPS/SSL: Sites that begin with “https://” e.g “https://www.google.com” as opposed to “http://www.google.com”, the connection between your browser and the server is secured using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) in conjunction with the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS). This combination of protocols ensures that the data exchanged between your computer and Google’s servers remains confidential and protected from potential eavesdropping or unauthorized access by encrypting the data transmitted between your browser and the server. This encryption process scrambles the data in such a way that only the intended recipient (in this case, Google’s server) can decipher it. This prevents any malicious actors or unauthorized individuals from intercepting and understanding the sensitive information being transmitted.

In our restaurant metaphor, the transition to a secure connection between your browser and the server is akin to the restaurant’s commitment to ensuring the privacy and integrity of your dining experience. Imagine a discreet waiter delivering your menu selections and ensuring that your conversations at Table 5 remain confidential and protected.

Picture the digital equivalent of your server (waiter) discreetly whispering your order to the kitchen (server backend) without revealing its details to anyone else in the restaurant. The encrypted communication ensures that only the intended recipient — Google’s server or the kitchen — can decipher and fulfill your requests. This fortified connection acts as a digital cloak, preventing any potential eavesdropping or unauthorized access, preserving the confidentiality of your online interactions just as a private dining experience protects your conversations in the restaurant.

To further enhance security, SSL or TLS certificates are used to authenticate the identity of the server. These certificates are issued by trusted third-party entities known as Certificate Authorities (CAs). When your browser establishes a connection with Google’s server, it verifies the authenticity of the server’s SSL or TLS certificate. This verification process ensures that you are indeed communicating with the genuine Google server and not an imposter or a malicious entity attempting to deceive you.

Load Balancer: Once your request has undergone verification and has been determined to be secure, it is distributed among servers on the network through the use of a load balancer. The load balancer employs various algorithms such as round robin — distributes incoming requests or tasks equally among a set of servers or resources in a circular order— or other algorithms to distribute the traffic. Its primary purpose is to eliminate any single points of failure at the server level and enhance the scalability of the network without risking any downtime. However, it is important to note that the load balancer itself can potentially become a single point of failure. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to employ multiple load balancers, either in an active-standby or active-active configuration.

In the bustling restaurant of digital interactions, the load balancer takes on the role of a seasoned maître d’, skillfully managing the flow of incoming patrons (requests) to ensure a seamless and efficient dining experience. Once your order has been verified and deemed secure, it’s time for the maître d’ to orchestrate the distribution of tasks among the chefs (servers) in the kitchen.

Much like the load balancer’s utilization of algorithms such as round robin to evenly distribute tasks among servers, the maître d’ ensures that each chef in the kitchen receives their fair share of orders. This strategic allocation serves to eliminate any potential bottleneck at the kitchen’s server level, allowing for a smoother and more scalable dining operation without the risk of downtime.

However, the maître d’ recognizes the importance of balance and acknowledges that even their role could become a potential point of vulnerability. To safeguard against this, the restaurant wisely employs multiple maître d’s, operating in an active-standby or active-active configuration. This redundancy ensures that, even if one maître d’ is temporarily indisposed, the dining experience can seamlessly continue under the watchful eye of another.

In some cases, the SSL certificate is located on the load balancer. This allows the load balancer to handle the encryption and decryption processes, relieving the individual servers of this task. By centralizing the SSL handling, the load balancer simplifies certificate management, improves efficiency, and enhances the overall security of the network. However, the configurations may vary, in other setups, SSL termination may be performed at the individual servers rather than the load balancer.

Web Server: After being distributed by the load balancer, the request then reaches one of Google’s web servers. Upon receiving the request, the web server processes the data and performs any necessary computations or operations. This can include retrieving relevant information from databases that store indexed web pages, executing sophisticated search algorithms to determine the most relevant results, and organizing the retrieved data into a format that can be displayed to the user.

The web server acts as the gateway between the user’s request and the vast amount of information stored within Google’s infrastructure. It efficiently processes the request, leveraging its computational power and access to various resources, to generate the desired response. This response typically includes the search results, which are carefully curated and ranked based on their relevance to the user’s query.

The web server’s role extends beyond just serving search results. It also handles other functionalities such as handling user authentication, managing user sessions, and delivering static content like images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files that comprise the visual elements of the search page.

Just like a master chef orchestrating a symphony of flavors, the web server processes your request with finesse. It delves into the vast pantry of Google’s infrastructure, retrieving the finest ingredients — relevant information stored in databases containing indexed web pages. These chefs don’t just serve up information; they execute sophisticated search algorithms, akin to crafting intricate recipes, to determine the most delectable and relevant results for your palate.

The web server, acting as the culinary maestro, then transforms these raw ingredients into a harmonious response, carefully curated and ranked like a chef presenting a beautifully plated dish. This response, your personalized search results, is not just information but a gastronomic delight of knowledge tailored to your taste.

Application Server: In the case of dynamic websites like Google, an application server plays a vital role in the overall process. The application server is responsible for executing server-side logic, which includes handling tasks such as user authentication, session management, and business logic. It works in conjunction with the web server to generate the content that will be sent back to your browser.

When a request reaches the application server, it processes the server-side code and performs various operations based on the specific requirements of the website or application. This can involve interacting with databases, performing calculations, and executing complex algorithms. The application server acts as a middleware between the web server and the backend systems, providing a platform for executing dynamic and interactive functionalities.

I don’t know exactly how to relate the application server in therestaurant analogy. However, envision the application server as a dedicated collaborator working seamlessly alongside the chef. Its role mirrors that of a meticulous assistant, diligently assisting the chef to ensure your cravings for delectable delights are met.

Database: In the case of Google, the application server may need to retrieve data from massive databases that store indexed information about web pages. These databases contain a vast amount of data that is organized and optimized for efficient retrieval.

When generating search results, the application server interacts with the database to retrieve relevant information based on the user’s query. This data includes details about web pages, their content, metadata, rankings, and various other factors that influence search results. The application server leverages the power of the database to efficiently retrieve and process this data, ensuring that the search results delivered to your browser are accurate and relevant.

The database serves as a crucial repository of information, allowing the application server to access and manipulate data required for generating the desired content. It plays a central role in supporting the search functionality and delivering up-to-date and relevant information to the users.

In our restaurant analogy, consider the database as the expansive and meticulously organized pantry of ingredients, essential for the creation of each culinary masterpiece. Just as a kitchen relies on a well-stocked pantry for a diverse array of recipes, the application server, acting as the chef’s culinary assistant, may need to fetch data from this vast culinary repository to craft a satisfying and flavorful dish.

When it comes to crafting your ideal meal — equivalent to generating search results — the culinary assistant (application server) interacts with the well-organized pantry (database) to retrieve the necessary ingredients (information). These ingredients include details about various culinary elements, such as the characteristics of dishes (web pages), their content (flavors), metadata (recipe details), rankings (popularity), and other factors that influence the dining experience (search results).

Just as a chef skillfully navigates the pantry to select and combine ingredients, the application server leverages the power of the database to efficiently retrieve and process the data needed. This dynamic interaction ensures that the resulting culinary creation — or in this case, the search results — satisfies your cravings for accuracy and relevance.

The seemingly instantaneous act of typing “https://www.google.com" and pressing Enter unveils a harmonious interplay of sophisticated technologies and systems. With each stage, from the initial DNS request to the final database query, contributing a vital piece to the puzzle, this orchestrated collaboration ensures the swift and secure delivery of web content to your browser. In navigating the complex landscape of the internet, this intricate dance of components converges to provide users with a seamless and safeguarded online experience. Truly remarkable, isn’t it?
